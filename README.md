Your team is creating a role playing game. You are tasked with the implementation of the shop feature. Create a "model.Player" object which has an Inventory, and Funds objects. The shop should contain at least 3 items, and it should be easy to add or remove items to and from the shop (don't use external config, only java code). The player should be able to purchase an item based on an item's ID. The funds should be removed from the player and added to the shop, and the item should be removed from the shop and added to the player when the player buys an item.

Try to get at least 90% code coverage
Don't create a public static void model
Keep your cyclomatic complexity below 5 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity)

Good luck, and have fun!
